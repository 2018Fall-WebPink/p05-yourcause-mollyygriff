        <h2> The Issue in Our Ocean:</h2>
        
            
        <p>The beach is a great place to spend your days at in the summer, 
            
        but it is not just your home in the summer. The ocean and beach is 
            
        home to many mammals and animals. Sea Turtles eggs hatch on the beach 
            
        and when the baby sea turtles are old enough they make their way to 
            
        the water. However, litter has become a big problem on our beaches 
            
        and in our waters. The Sea Turtles are getting caught in trash like 
            
        plastic bags and mistaking plastic bottles for food and dying from 
            
        it. We need to save the sea turtles and throw our trash away! </p>
                 
        <h2> Why are Sea Turtles Important?</h2>
        
        <p>Sea Turtles are beautiful animals, but in great danger. We need to 
            
        protect these animals because they are important to our ecosystem. 
            
        They control sponge distribution, feast on jellyfish so we won't get 
            
        stung, and transport nutrients. Sea Turtles play a vital role on 
            
        keeping our oceans healthy and more and more are being killed from 
            
        careless people who don't throw their trash out. We need to protect 
            
        these beautiful and defensless creatures as much as we can becuse 
            
        they keep our ecosystem going in the ocean. 4,600 Sea Turtles are
            
        killed everyday in the US which is heart breaking.Sea Turtles need a 
            
        clean ocean to live in so we need to do our part just like the 
            
        turtles do. We need to clean our trash so no sea animals will get 
            
        tied up and stuck in it or eat it and choke because they think it 
            
        is food. </p>

        <p>The threats facing sea turtles are numerous and, for the most 
            
        part, humans are the problem. For those of us trying to protect sea 
            
        turtles, it is a mixed blessing that so many threats are human-
            
        caused. On one hand, it is very hard to change human behavior. On the 
            
        other hand, at least there is hope for eliminating threats. If sea 
            
        turtles were going extinct because of geological or climatic changes, 
            
        there would be very little we could do to help.In contrast with some 
            
        other at-risk species, perhaps sea turtles have been easier to manage 
            
        because their threats are more tangible: They are accidentally 
            
        trapped by fishermen or harvested by others as delicacies, 
            
        aphrodisiacs or decoration. In the most extreme cases, like in 
            
        Tortuguero, Costa Rica, nearly all female green turtles at one point 
            
        had been exported for turtle soup.As part of our mission of sea 
            
        turtle conservation, Sea Turtle, Inc. administers nesting sea turtle 
            
        patrols on the beaches of South Padre Island and Boca Chica.  The 
            
        primary sea turtle that nests on these beaches is the Kemp's ridley.  
        During nesting season, specially trained volunteers and interns 
            
        search our beaches for nesting female sea turtles and their tracks. 
            
        This allows us to find the nests and relocate them to a safe 
            
        location. Sea turtle nests are protected through spring/summer 
            
        incubation period.Seven different species of sea (or marine) turtles 
            
        grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian 
            
        Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle, and even the 
            
        sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. WWFâ€™s work on sea turtles 
            
        focuses on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, 
            
        leatherback and olive ridley.</p>
